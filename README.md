# Translucency-JOV2021

**300_ImgColor**
The stimuli used in the color condition in the main paper.

**300_ImgGray_Lightness**
The stimuli used in the grayscale condition in the main paper. The RGB images are converted to CIELab space, and we extracted, duplicated, and then concatenated the lightness channel.

**Gray_contrast preserveds**
The stimuli used in the grayscale condition in the supplementary material. The RGB images are converted to the grayscale by using a Contrast Preserved Decolorization method in OpenCV (Lu et al. (2012)).
